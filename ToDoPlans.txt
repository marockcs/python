At first need to buy an iphone and apple watch or airpods
If I'll have a time after work start learning python
But in near future need to learn php or other lanuage to be sure
Most likely I'll teach JS and NodeJS or other crap.
I hope that crap will help to move for some time from fucking war in my country
